$title	Check Mappings between Summary and Detailed Sectors and Commodities

$ontext

Estimates in the Industry Economic Accounts of the Bureau of Economic
Analysis (BEA) are generally available at four levels of detail:
sector (21 industry groups), summary (71 industry groups), underlying
summary (138 industry groups), and detail (402 industry groups). For
most data products, estimates at the detail level are available only
for estimate year 2017. This table shows the relationship between
these four levels of detail as well as how each level relates to the
2017 North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code
structure.
