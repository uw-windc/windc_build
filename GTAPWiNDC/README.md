# Description
The GTAP Consortium (http://www.gtap.org) provides a documented,
publicly available, global, general equilibrium data base. It also
conducts seminars on a regular basis to inform the research community
about how to use the data in applied economic analysis.

The GTAP version 11 database represents global production and trade for
xx country/regions, xx commodities and xx primary factors. The data
characterize intermediate demand and bilateral trade in xx, 2011, 2014
and 2017, including tax rates on imports and exports and other indirect
taxes.

In collaboration with GTAP researchers, the US Department of Agriculture
and other WiNDC consortium members we have produced a version of the
WiNDC 50 state database and model which may be embedded within a
multiregional (global) GTAP model. The single region in the GTAP dataset
is replaced by 50 states in the GTAPWiNDC dataset. USA national totals
from GTAP 11 are retained in the extended model.

The principal programming language for GTAP data and modeling work is
GEMPACK. In the GEMPACK framework the model is solved as a system of
nonlinear equations. Our implementation of the GTAPWiNDC model is
provided in GAMS. The build stream which reconciles
the database and the illustrative models are provided here with tools
which permit users to aggregate, filter and adjust benchmark datasets.

The GTAPWiNDC buildstream incorporates data from either the publicly 
available GTAP 9 release or proprietary GTAP 11 release. To inquire 
about obtaining a license for the GTAP 11 database, visit the 
[GTAP website](https://www.gtap.agecon.purdue.edu/databases/v11/). 
The GTAP version 9 database is included in our data distribution.

You must build both `core` and `household` prior to building 
`GTAPWiNDC`. 


# File Listing

1. `gtapingams.gms` - This file needs to be user modified. This controls which version of GTAP to use and where the datafile is located. Explicit directions are detailed in this file. 


2. `build.gms` - Builds GTAP and GTAPWiNDC datasets.

    Inputs: `gtapingams.gms`, `gtap*/gtap*/g20_32.gdx`, `gtap*/gtap*/g20_43.gdx`, `household/datasets/cps_static_all_2017.gdx`

    Outputs: `%year%/`

    Command line options:
    |Command|Options| Default | Description |
    | ---   | ---   | --- | ---|
	| year | gtap11/a: 2017, 2014, 2011 -- gtap9: 2011 | 2017 | The year to run |
    
	Data files exist for 2004 and 2007, but these do not have carbon
	and energy data.  They could be used if those inputs are dropped
	from the code.

3. `gtap_model.gms` - Replicates the benchmark equilibrium for the input GTAP model.

    Inputs: `gtapingams.gms`, `gtap*/gtap*/g20_32.gdx`, `gtap*/gtap*/g20_43.gdx`

4. `write_stub.gms` - Read the GTAP dataset (20_32/20_43), add array dimensions for households (h) and subregions (s). The GTAP data is loaded for household and subregion "rest".

    Inputs: `gtapingams.gms`, `gtap*/gtap*/g20_32.gdx`, `gtap*/gtap*/g20_43.gdx`

    Outputs: `%year%/gtapwindc/32_stub.gdx`, `%year%/gtapwindc/32_stub.gdx`

5. `gtapwindc_data.gms`, `gtapwindc_mge.gms`, `gtapwindc_mcp.gms` - Scripts which replicate the benchmark equilibrium for the output GTAP_WiNDC model (GAMS/MCP and GAMS/MPSGE). This runs several times during the build process, once for the stub dataset and once for the combined data.

6. `windc_data.gms` - Loads the WiNDC household data.

    Inputs: `household/datasets/cps_static_all_2017.gdx`

7. `windc_model.gms` - Replicates the benchmark equilibrium for the WiNDC household model.

    Inputs: `household/datasets/cps_static_all_2017.gdx` 

8. `agrdisagg.gms` - This routine only runs on the g20_43 disaggregation. 

We construct the disaggregated dataset in two steps. The first of these concerns only the 50 state / 250 household WiNDC model. We use state shares of agricultural receipts to disaggregate the AGR into 11 separate agricultural sectors

	The original WiNDC dataset has but one agricultural sector:

		agr  Farms and farm products (111CA)

	In this step `agr` is disaggregated into 11
	sectors corresponding to agricultural sectors in GTAP:

	|Key|Description|
	|---|---|
	|pdr|Paddy rice|
	|wht|Wheat|
	|gro|Cereal grains nec|
	|v_f|Vegetables, fruit, nuts|
	|osd|Oil seeds|
	|c_b|Sugar cane, sugar beet|
	|pfb|Plant-based fibers|
	|ocr|Crops nec|
	|ctl|Bovine cattle, sheep, goats and horses|
	|oap|Animal products nec|
	|rmk|Raw milk|
	|wol|Wool, silk-worm cocoons|

    Inputs: `gtapingams.gms`, `household/datasets/cps_static_gtap_32_state.gdx`, `gtap*/gtap*/%year%/g20_43.gdx`

    Outputs: `%year%/windc/43.gdx`



9. `regiondisagg.gms` - Disaggregate states and households in the corresponding 32/43 sector GTAP model.

    Inputs: `%year%/windc/g20_*.gdx`, `%year%/gtapwindc/g20_*_stub.gdx`, 
    
    Outputs: `%year%/gtapwindc/g20_*.gdx`, `%year%/gtapwindc/g20_*_proportional.gdx`
