Some Documentation on Sectoral Identifiers in GTAPinGAMS
--------------------------------------------------------

1. Name changes TO accommodate GTAPinGAMS conventions for energy goods:

	OIL.CRU	! "Crude Oil",
	COA.COL	! "Coal",
	P_C.OIL	! "Petroleum, coal products",
	ELY.ELE	! "Electricity",

In order to use ELE for electricity, we need a new identifier
to represent electronic equipment.   In GTAPinGAMS versions 9 and
earlier, we replaced ELE by EEQ. GTAP 10p3 now introduces EEQ as a
new sector ("electrical equipment"), and we therefore use a new
identifier, CEO, to replace ELE:

	ELE.CEO	! "Computer, electronic and optical products",

2. Sectors in which GTAP 10p3 has simply changed the identifier:

OMN	OXT 	"Other Extraction (formerly omn Minerals nec)",
ISR	INS 	"Insurance (formerly isr)",


3. Sectors which have been disaggregated in GTAP10P3

There are 65 sectors in 10p3 (and later), 57 in 10p2 (and earlier), so
we have 8 additional sectors:

+2 -- CRP: Chemical Rubber Products: basic chemicals, other chemical
products, rubber and plastics products

	CHM 	"Chemical products",
	BPH 	"Basic pharmaceutical products",
	RPP 	"Rubber and plastic products",

+2 -- OSG: Other Services (Government): public administration and
defense; compulsory social security, education, health and social
work, sewage and refuse disposal, sanitation and similar activities,
activities of membership organizations n.e.c., extra-territorial
organizations and bodies

	OSG 	"Public Administration and defense",
	EDU 	"Education",
	HHT 	"Human health and social work activities",

+1 -- TRD: Trade: all retail sales; wholesale trade and commission
trade; hotels and restaurants; repairs of motor vehicles and personal
and household goods; retail sale of automotive fuel

	TRD 	"Trade",
	AFS 	"Accommodation, Food and service activities",

+1 -- OTP: Other Transport: road, rail ; pipelines, auxiliary
transport activities; travel agencies

	OTP	"Transport nec",
	WHS 	"Warehousing and support activities",

+1 -- OBS: Other Business Services: real estate, renting and business
activities

	OBS 	"Business services nec",
	RSA 	"Real estate activities",

+1 -- OME: Manufacture of machinery and equipment n.e.c.
	OME 	"Machinery and equipment nec",
	EEQ	"Electrical equipment"		

In GTAP version prior to 10p3 we substituted EEQ to represent
"electronic equipment" to replace ELE.
