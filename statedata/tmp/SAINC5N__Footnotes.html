<LI>1.&nbsp;The estimates of earnings for 1998-2006 are based on the 2002 North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). The estimates for 2007-2010 are based on the 2007 NAICS. The estimates for 2011-2016 are based on the 2012 NAICS. The estimates for 2017 forward are based on the 2017 NAICS.</LI>
<LI>2.&nbsp;Census Bureau midyear population estimate. BEA produced intercensal annual state population statistics for 2010 to 2019 that are tied to the Census Bureau decennial counts for 2010 and 2020. BEA developed intercensal population statistics because this data was not published when Census released state population data for 2020 through 2023, which are based on the 2020 decennial counts. BEA used the Census Bureau Das Gupta method (see https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/technical-documentation/methodology/intercensal/2000-2010-intercensal-estimates-methodology.pdf), modified to account for an extra leap year day, to produce the intercensal population figures that will be used until Census releases its official intercensal population data in 2024.</LI>
<LI>3.&nbsp;Per capita personal income is total personal income divided by total midyear population. BEA produced intercensal population statistics for 2010 to 2019 that are tied to the Census Bureau decennial counts for 2010 and 2020 to create consistent time series that are used to prepare per capita personal income statistics. BEA used the Census Bureau Das Gupta method (see https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/technical-documentation/methodology/intercensal/2000-2010-intercensal-estimates-methodology.pdf), modified to account for an extra leap year day, to produce the intercensal population figures that will be used until Census releases its official intercensal population data in 2024.</LI>

<LI>7.&nbsp;Includes actual employer contributions and actuarially imputed employer contributions to reflect benefits accrued by defined benefit pension plan participants through service to employers in the current period.</LI>
<LI>8.&nbsp;Proprietors' income includes the inventory valuation adjustment and the capital consumption adjustment.</LI>
<LI>9.&nbsp;Under the 2007 NAICS, internet publishing and broadcasting was reclassified to other information services.</LI>
